## Overview
This is my final project in the CMPSC 100 class. The purpose of this project is to simulate a battle in Pokemon. First, we randomly choose 2 Pokemons out of a dictionary and then let them fighting with each other authomatically. In the battle process, monsters can attack, and when the health point is not so high, monster has possibility to try to heal itself or even escape from this battle. Furthermore, user's monster might try to catch the adversary monster when that monster has low health point.
## Output

Based on the fact that is just my first project in my first Computer Science class, the functions are simple. By running without any extract commands, you can get the outputs like below

1. Charmander attacks Bulbasaur with 16 hp  
Bulbasaur attacks Charmander with 31 hp  
Charmander attacks Bulbasaur with 19 hp  
Bulbasaur attacks Charmander with 18 hp  
Charmander attacks Bulbasaur with 17 hp  
Bulbasaur attacks Charmander with 30 hp

Bulbasaur attacks Charmander with 23 hp  
Charmander heals itself.  
Bulbasaur attacks Charmander with 27 hp  
Charmander tries to capture Bulbasaur..... it succeeds. The battle ends  
Charmander wins!  


2. Charmander attacks Squirtle with 23 hp

Charmander has healed once, so intead it attacks this time   
Squirtle attacks Charmander with 20 hp  
Squirtle wins!  





## Ideas within codes

The fundamentaional mechanism in this project is random. All the processes are randomly and automatically pushed without any human-made input. For this reason, random method counts a lot in my project. For example, the attack demage is totally a random value in a restrained realm. Except that, anohter crucial element in my project is if statement. To make monsters' battle more impressive, They should have mulitple moves. If statement, therefore, are able to achieve this idea and are also the most difficult part in my project. As a smart and ideal Pokemon monster, it should do its choice by considering both its own and enemy's hleath points. For that, when one monster has low health point, Both sides may do special moves like healing, capturing and escaping.
