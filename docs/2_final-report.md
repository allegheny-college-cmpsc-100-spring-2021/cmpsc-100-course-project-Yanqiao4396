# Course project final report

Yanqiao Chen

## Final title

Pokemon simple battle 

## If you used any data sources, what were they and why?
Just based on what I know about data source, I didn't use any one.


## How did the final project end up? Were you able to achieve your ideal (or close to it)?

It succeeded to work what I want it to do. I really have a automatical battle which picks monsters itself, has mutiple moves and has mutiple endings. That's very cool. I was able to achieve my ideal. I thought that I may can just achieve a few parts of my goals and therefore would have to delete some interesting systems like capture and healing systems I like very much. But the fact is I make it. Cool!

## Did your project change over time? If so, how?

Of course. As a new in computational science, this is the first time for me to program myself. So there were a lot of bugs when I wrote my codes. Especially because I wasn't so good at using class, I messed up plenty of times in process. The best example is that didn't know that my dictionaries should be in form of self.ababa. Also, I wasn't so clear with what self means very much. So I edited my programmes more than just one time.

## Describe your approaches and experience with the project.
Although the battle is very easy compared with Pokemon, the project is still challenging. But fortunately, I totally enjoy it. I have a feeling of creating something myself. And it feels good that put your ideas into reality.
### What worked?

Most parts worked. Like healing, escape, capture events. 

### What didn't?

When I thought of what this battle should be, I had a idea to have a counter system. But I found it could make my program very complicated when I esstially typed codes. So I gave up it.

### What would you have done differently?

The way to break the while loop. I thought I could use break command in my while loop to exit my battle. But thanks to the guidance of Prof. Luman, I noticed that I can't break but instead I can let my monster do nothing. So the outcome is that it looks like terminal skips the rest parts, but actually it does nothing on those parts instead.


### What was the biggest challenge that you overcame? How did you do it?

The choices my monster have based on both its and enemy's hp. So monster's move is affected by 2 elements. That can make if statements a little complicated. So the way I choice to solve this problem is using 6 if statements. But I can promise it's not the best way, although I chose it.
