I have completed my most of my battle part. I have escape, turn, heal, attack systems now.

In my program, the player's monster's behavior needs to be affected by its hp and enemy's hp. So I find I can only let its behavior directed by its own hp. So that means I can't make it try to capture enemy. Also, since my program is simple, the json you give me contains too much information. Can I just make a directary other than something like that one?

## Celebrate your successes. What are they?

At first, I thought the behaviors of two monsters are similar, so I wanted to put them into just one function just like what you did. But because I found that they should attack alternately and that player's enemy has more choices, I seperate them. In the matter of my capture system, I success in pushing it in a way that the less hp enemy has, the higher rate you have for capturing.
